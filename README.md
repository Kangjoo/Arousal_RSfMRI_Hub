# arousal-rsfMRIpupil-hub

* 'SPARK_fMRI_pupillometry.m' performs a four-step analysis: 

           (STEP 1) Pupillometry processing.

           (STEP 2) State stratification of fMRI data using pupillometry

           (STEP 3) Bootstrap resampling of state-stratified fMRI data

           (STEP 4) Sparse dictionary learning of resampled data

* Other scripts to implement the remainings of the SPARK analysis, such as the parallel implementation of the sparse dictionary learning, spatial K-means clustering, background noise removal, and k-hubness estimation, can be found and adapted from [SPARK](https://github.com/multifunkim/spark-matlab).   

* 'SPARK_HDI.m' computes the hub disruption index (HDI) to compare k-hubness estimated from fMRI data in two arousal states, e.g., high and low arousal.

# Requirements

* SParsity-based Analysis of Reliable K-hubness ([SPARK](https://github.com/multifunkim/spark-matlab))

* Neuroimaging Analysis Kit ([NIAK](https://github.com/SIMEXP/niak)) - preferred version: niak-boss-0.13.0.  

* [SPM8](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/) or [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) is required to process pupillometry data.
